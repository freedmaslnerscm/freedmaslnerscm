Here’s a typical borrowing scenario: A user opens the app and requests an advance. Qualification requirements vary, but most apps review transaction history from a connected bank account or a work time sheet the user has provided to determine the advance amount. Once approved, the app displays the repayment date — typically the user’s next payday — and requests a tip before sending the cash.

Cash advance apps say tips allow borrowers to decide what to pay because if they can’t afford to tip, they don’t have to. Sharmaine Rouse, who uses the popular app EarnIn, says she prefers an optional tip to the mandatory fee common with payday loans.

“I think the tipping option is a little better than them forcing you to pay a fee because at the end of the day, it’s still your own choice; you can put zero if you wanted to,” she says.

EarnIn CEO Ram Palaniappan says the tipping feature forces the company to provide a product worthy of a tip.
